It means that I must everlastingly seek to cleanse myself of the hatred and the contempt that surrounds and permeates my identity, as a woman, and as a Black human being, in this particular world of ours.”  - June Jordan.</p>\n<p>\n  <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/1-93eeb3590cf49d8e34a35f8e7775c3be-a2836.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n  \n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; ; max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 129.43432406519656%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Photo by @ssimondmv\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/1-93eeb3590cf49d8e34a35f8e7775c3be-f8fb9.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/1-93eeb3590cf49d8e34a35f8e7775c3be-e8976.jpg 148w,\n/static/1-93eeb3590cf49d8e34a35f8e7775c3be-63df2.jpg 295w,\n/static/1-93eeb3590cf49d8e34a35f8e7775c3be-f8fb9.jpg 590w,\n/static/1-93eeb3590cf49d8e34a35f8e7775c3be-85e3d.jpg 885w,\n/static/1-93eeb3590cf49d8e34a35f8e7775c3be-a2836.jpg 1043w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n  </a>\n    </p>\n<p><em>Photo by @ssimondmv</em></p>\n<h2>Academic</h2>\n<p>I’m currently a senior doubling in computer science and communication. I received a certificate in public leadership in 2017. I’m a co-founder of Ladies of Computer Science (LOCS), the first all-women academic club at Maryland.</p>\n<h2>Professional</h2>\n<p>My career goals include getting certified in project management and working either in L.A. or New York. I plan to learn 2D and 3D animation and try some freelance work on the side. I want to make infographics on programming topics for children. My dream job in the future would ultimately be making children’s movies, or starting my own company.</p>\n<h2>Personal</h2>\n<p>At UMD, I’m on the women’s club volleyball team. I’ve been playing for 7 years now. I’m also extremely interested in fashion and social justice.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About Me","date":"October 05, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/hi-folks/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/about/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"About Me"}},"next":null}}
