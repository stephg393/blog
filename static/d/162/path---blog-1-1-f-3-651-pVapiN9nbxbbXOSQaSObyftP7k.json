The convenience of getting your work done without having to go to be at set location nine-to-five everyday is a way of life I never thought of before. Communication platforms such as Google Hangout have been an imperative part of my internship. Through this channel, I had weekly updates, conducted my user and usability research, and participated in lessons taught by my mentor for the week. In addition to the internship, Allision guided me to obtain a grant from Maryland Tech Connection which allowed me to purchase courses through DataCamp and further develop skills with Git and Python. Through this internship I had the amazing opportunity to rotate through a number of projects with the help of some very talented mentors.</p>\n<h2>Business + Marketing</h2>\n<h3>Mentors:</h3>\n<p>Dianna Berisha &#x26; Allison Kunz</p>\n<h4>Summary</h4>\n<p>My first project was to build a competitive landscape analysis. At first I was overwhelmed; I felt like every little detail was important; every color, image and slogan must be noted. I used Google Sheets to document variables for each freeelance marketplace platform such as pain-points, number of users, subscription prices and features. This analysis in addition to networking at technology events allowed the company to narrow down their niche and focus on a product that can be delivered ASAP.</p>\n<h4>Takeaways</h4>\n<p>Research at first seemed daunting. One weakness I noticed was that it was easy to dig yourself in a hole and get too much information on one company that might not be helpful when comparing all the companies on a greater scale. However from the input, recommendations and business articles Dianna provided, I was able to begin filtering through each platform for essential information. In conclusion, I learned that although landscape analyses may be tedious they are essential to a start-up company because it allows one to see what other companies are doing and how we can make do it better.</p>\n<h2>User Research + UX Design</h2>\n<h3>Mentor:</h3>\n<p>Charles Haitkin</p>\n<h4>Summary</h4>\n<p>This rotation encompassed two aspects of being a UX designer, creation and revision. First, Charles walked me through his first prototype of Free Agency’s login process and submitting a proposal. As we went through the prototype he asked questions that provided information on how much the user understands how to handle the site.</p>\n<h5>Account Page</h5>\n<h4>Takeaways</h4>\n<h2>ReactJS</h2>\n<h3>Mentor:</h3>\n<p>Allison Kunz</p>\n<h4>Summary</h4>\n<h4>Takeaways</h4>","frontmatter":{"title":"Free Agency Internship","date":"October 05, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog-1/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hi-folks/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"About Me"}},"next":null}}
