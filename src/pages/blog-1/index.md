*Internships.* An opportunity to explore your career options and asses what you love and what you don’t ever want to look at after it’s over.
This summer I was lucky enough to meet Allison Kunz, founder of Free Agency and my mentor from Rewriting the Code, who bestowed me the opportunity to be an intern for her company which aligned perfectly with my summer schedule—I got to work remotely. The convenience of getting your work done without having to be at set location nine-to-five every day is a way of life I never thought of before. Communication platforms such as Google Hangout have been an imperative part of my internship. Through this channel, I had weekly updates, conducted my user and usability research, and participated in lessons taught by my mentor for the week. In addition to the internship, Allison guided me in obtaining a grant from Maryland Tech Connection which allowed me to purchase courses through DataCamp and further develop skills with Git and Python. Through this internship I had the amazing opportunity to rotate through a number of projects with the help of some very talented mentors.

##Business + Marketing
###Mentors:
####Dianna Berisha & Allison Kunz

###SUMMARY
My first project was to build a competitive landscape analysis. At first I was overwhelmed; I felt like every little detail was important; every color, image and slogan must be noted. I used Google Sheets to document variables for each freelance marketplace platform such as pain-points, number of users, subscription prices and features. In addition to the analysis, I went to a few networking events to find freelancers and consultants to contact for user and usability research.

###TAKEAWAYS
Research at first seemed daunting. One weakness I noticed was that it was easy to dig yourself in a hole and get too much information on one company that might not be helpful when comparing all the companies on a greater scale. However, from the input, recommendations and business articles Dianna provided, I was able to begin filtering through each platform for essential information. In conclusion, I learned that although landscape analyses may be tedious they are essential to a start-up company because it allows one to see what other companies are doing and how we can do it better.

##User Research + UX Design
###Mentor:
####Charles Haitkin & Allison Kunz
###SUMMARY
####User and Usability interviews
This rotation encompassed two aspects of being a UX designer, creation and revision. First, Charles walked me through his prototype of Free Agency’s login process and proposal submission on InVision. As we went through the prototype, he asked multiple questions that provided information on the user’s understanding and ability to handle the site. After the walkthrough, Charles presented me with the user research script for this prototype. I utilized this script to conduct my own interviews with freelancers and consultants I met through networking events. Majority of my interviews were conducted through Google Hangouts or over the phone.
####Account Page
After conducting the interviews, I created my first wireframes for the account page and the account settings page, which ranged from low to mid fidelity. I create two versions of the account setting page that were then reviewed by Charles. During our review session, I went through each design element and its purpose. The feedback I received from this review was critical in my development as a designer. I learned that there is an incredible amount of consideration and attention to detail to every decision since it impacts the user’s experience.

Next, I created wireframes for the account page. In order to develop my design, I researched account profiles of various platforms and noted what content was included, what content wasn’t included, and how the information was organized. For this process, I initially started with a design that I developed using my research. Then, I sent Allison screenshots of my wireframe and use her feedback to make improvements.

###TAKEAWAYS
From this rotation I acquired a firm understanding of the importance of design and its role in building a product. Your website, or application is where the user gets their first impressions; color, typography, infographics and negative space are all critical elements in defining the user’s experience. Not only did I gain skills in Adobe XD and InVision, but I improved my interviewing skills with experienced professional. Networking not only benefited this company, but my own opportunities for development as well. I’m excited use the skills I’ve established to learn Sketch in the future and build my own hi fidelity prototypes.

##Gatsby + React
###Mentor:
####Allison Kunz
###SUMMARY
For the last rotation of my internship I created my own blog. I learned React through developing my own site using GatsbyJS. I followed the step-by-step tutorial and set up my development environment. I used node.js as my command prompt for Gatsby and used Atom as my text editor.

At first, all the tasks in the tutorial were working properly until I attempted to deploy my site onto Git. This resulted in many errors in the command prompt that were confusing and troublesome to resolve. However, after going over the bugs with Allison, she provided additional instructions that weren’t provided in the tutorial that allowed me to continue creating my page.
After consulting with Allison, I decided to review React code, so I could get a better understanding of how to edit the starter pages. Finally, I was able to use another starter blog, personalize it and get it up and running on Git.


###TAKEAWAYS
In the beginning using someone’s starter page was easy to edit until I actually had to deploy it. Their code has a lot of parts and folders that aren’t necessary for my needs. So it’s important to filter through everything to make sure you’re 1. Not releasing personal information and that two you have removed all the information of the author.

Once I was able to deploy my page and have it shown I got more interested in making it more myself and played around with typography and images. I enjoyed how I could use a template and make it my own, however, since I’m in school mode I wanted to learn all the intricacies which hurt me when I was starting. It was a different way of learning for me to just enter the trial and error phase. In contrast, when I learn a language at school I’m first introduced to the concepts such as functions, variables and the data structures of that language, before handling code. This project challenged me to adjust my learning style which has improved my confidence in trusting my previous coding experience to try a new language.

##CONCLUSION

All in all, I’m extremely grateful for the opportunity to test out my diverse range of skills in a start-up environment. Although I was an intern, I never felt lost or unheard. Every interaction was meaningful; my mentors truly cared about my growth and provided me with ample resources when I mentioned an interested in a subject. Along with each virtual meeting, I was able to ask questions to my mentors about their work experience in the tech field to help shape my own aspirations for my future career. For example, when I mentioned my interest in developing my skills in animation Allison provided me with links she deemed useful. In addition, I had the opportunity to interview a 3-D effects freelancer, who recommend drawing pads and animation software for beginners.
After reviewing each rotation, I learned that although business research is vital (i.e. landscape analysis); my strengths lie in design and creation. Conducting research has strengthen my organizational and interpersonal skills, which will be useful if I decide to go the project manager route.

I enjoyed creating wireframes and the blog since they rely significantly on visual aspects when executed. In Adobe XD and Gatsby, my edits made changes in real time which allowed trial and error to be seamless. Design and implementation is what attracts me the most to computer science. I want build, I want to create, and I want to use these unique set of skills to improve lives of others. Since most of my work was done remotely, this internship has encouraged me to put my educational growth in my own hands and take these skills I’ve gained into my next work experience.
